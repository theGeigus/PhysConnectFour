# WINONA STATE PHYSICS / COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECT

This project aims to create an interactive Connect-4 style game. It would be placed in the Physics Club display case in Pasteur Hall. 

Currently, the plan is to have CS Club develop the website side that would allow players to make their moves, and for Physics Club to make the physical side of the board.

Currently, the project is set up to use React + Typescipt + Vite, but can change if so desired (such as choosing to use Holy C instead).
